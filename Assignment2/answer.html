            In a small Italian town, hundreds of years ago, a small business owner owed a large sum of money to a loan-shark. The loan-shark was a very old, unattractive looking guy that just so happened to fancy the business owner’s daughter.He decided to offer the businessman a deal that would completely wipe out the debt he owed him. 
            However, the catch was that we would only wipe out the debt if he could marry the businessman’s daughter.Needless to say, this proposal was met with a look of disgust.The daughter would then have to reach into the bag and pick out a pebble. If it was black, the debt would be wiped, but the loan-shark would then marry her.
            If it was white, the debt would also be wiped, but the daughter wouldn’t have to marry the loan-shark.Standing on a pebble-strewn path in the businessman’s garden, the loan-shark bent over and picked up two pebbles.
            Whilst he was picking them up, the daughter noticed that he’d picked up two black pebbles and placed them both into the bag.
           <strong>“Oh, how clumsy of me. Never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.”</strong>
            The pebble left in the bag is obviously black, and seeing as the loan-shark didn’t want to be exposed, he had to play along as if the pebble the daughter dropped was white, and clear her father’s debt.

         <h2>2.Best Car Brands</h2>
         <p>
           <strong>Audi</strong>,  <strong>Porsche</strong>,<strong>Mini</strong> and <strong>Toyota</strong> rounded out the top brand rankings. Buick was the highest-rated domestic brand, placing 11th. Jeep ranked the lowest of all brands, followed by GMC, Mitsubishi, Land Rover and Alfa Romeo.The name Audi translates from Latin into the word "listen" or to hear. Which sounds odd for a car manufacturer but I'll explain why. 
            Audi began through the merging of four auto manufacturers. Which is where they get their four ring logo. 
            One of those people involved was a man named August Horch.The following year the division was incorporated as the Toyota Motor Company, Ltd., headed by Kiichiro. (The company’s name was changed to Toyota, which has a more pleasing sound in Japanese.) Toyota subsequently established several related companies, including Toyoda Machine Works, Ltd. (1941), and Toyota Auto Body, Ltd. 
            (1945).What does the word Porsche mean? What does the word Porsche mean? The name Porsche is of German origin and means 'offerings'. Disclaimer: You acknowledge and agree that all answers are provided as a general guide only and should not be relied upon as bespoke advice.
            For example, the Wesley Hornet was a longer, more luxurious version of the Mini targeted at the rich. There was also a Mini Van designed to haul items for businesses as well as a Mini Pick-up to meet similar needs. BMC also built the Moke - a Mini-based utility vehicle intended for the British army.

         <h2>3.Most Luxurious Car</h2>
         <p>
            As opposed to most other picks on our list, Lexus is a brand that only came out in 1989 when their flagship LS 400 hit the scene. Ever since they first came out, they managed to attract a lot of attention thanks to their obvious obsession with making the most luxurious car in the world.
            As of my last update in September 2021, the most luxurious car models were from brands like Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Maybach, and Aston Martin, among others. These luxury car manufacturers are known for producing vehicles that offer high levels of craftsmanship, premium materials, cutting-edge technology, and an unparalleled driving experience.
            Some of the top contenders for the title of the most luxurious car included:
            Rolls-Royce Phantom: Often regarded as the pinnacle of luxury cars, the Phantom is known for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and prestigious presence.Bentley Mulsanne: Bentley is synonymous with luxury, and the Mulsanne exemplifies this with its handcrafted interior and powerful performance.Mercedes-Maybach S-Class: The Maybach variant of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class offers a luxurious experience with an extended wheelbase, 
            lavish amenities, and state-of-the-art features.
            Aston Martin DBS Superleggera: While known for their sporty appeal, Aston Martin's DBS Superleggera also delivers a luxurious interior and advanced features.Rolls-Royce Cullinan: This is Rolls-Royce's first-ever SUV, combining off-road capabilities with the expected luxury and refinement of the brand.It's worth noting that the definition of luxury can vary from person to person, and the automotive industry is constantly evolving. 
            Therefore, newer, more luxurious models may have been introduced since my last update.
            Always check with the latest information from automotive sources to see the most current and luxurious car models available.

         <h2>4.Percentage of Population</h2>
         <p>
            Approximately 17.5 percent of the global population currently lives in India, a mere 0.5 percent less than China. Pakistan has experienced recent population increases, growing by an astonishing 57 percent since 1998 due in part to high birthrates.
            As of my last update in September 2021, India's population was estimated to be over 1.3 billion people. However, please note that population figures are constantly changing due to births, deaths, and migration. To get the most up-to-date population data for India, 
            I recommend checking official sources like the Government of India's Ministry of Home Affairs or the United Nations Population Division. 
            Additionally, you can refer to the latest census data or population estimates from reputable organizations for the most accurate and current information.

         <a name="Gaussian Law"></a>
         <h2>5.Gaussian Law</h2>
        <p>
            In physics and electromagnetism, Gauss's law, also known as <strong>Gauss's flux theorem</strong>, (or sometimes simply called Gauss's theorem) is a law relating the distribution of electric charge to the resulting electric field. In its integral form, it states that the flux of the electric field out of an arbitrary closed surface is proportional to the electric charge enclosed by the surface, irrespective of how that charge is distributed. 
            Even though the law alone is insufficient to determine the electric field across a surface enclosing any charge distribution, 
            this may be possible in cases where symmetry mandates uniformity of the field. Where no such symmetry exists, Gauss's law can be used in its differential form, which states that the divergence of the electric field is proportional to the local density of charge.
            I believe you meant "Gauss's Law," named after the German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss. Gauss's Law is a fundamental principle in electromagnetism, specifically in the study of electric fields and their relation to electric charges.
            Gauss's Law states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the total electric charge enclosed by that surface divided by the electric constant (also known as the vacuum permittivity or epsilon-naught, denoted by ε₀).
            In mathematical terms, Gauss's Law can be expressed as:

                <pre>                                   <strong>g∮E · dA = (1/ε₀) * ∫ρ dV</strong>              </pre>

            Here's what the equation represents:∮E · dA: The integral of the electric field (E) dotted with the area vector (dA) over a closed surface (the symbol "∮" denotes a closed surface integral).∫ρ dV: The integral of the electric charge density (ρ) over the volume (V) enclosed by the closed surface.
            In simpler terms, Gauss's Law essentially tells us that the total electric field passing through a closed surface (the flux) is proportional to the total charge enclosed by that surface.One of the most common applications of Gauss's Law is to calculate the electric field of symmetrical charge distributions. Due to its symmetry, 
            it can be challenging to compute the electric field directly using the Coulomb's law for every individual charge. Gauss's Law provides a more straightforward method to determine the electric field in such cases.Keep in mind that Gauss's Law is a foundational concept in electromagnetism and plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of electric fields and charges. 
            It is widely used in physics and engineering, particularly in analyzing electric fields generated by various charge distributions and understanding the behavior of conductors and insulators in electrostatics.
